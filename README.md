# Heart Disease Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health-related parameters to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors that contribute to heart disease risk. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

You can access the dataset from the following link:
[Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook to run the project step by step.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-classification
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart-disease-classification.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC curve

## Results
The final model achieved high accuracy and reliable classification results. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
